		  <h1 class="title">Requesting Recommendation Letters</h1>

                  <p>
As a professor I often get asked if I will write a recommendation letter for current or former students. In general I am happy to oblige for students that have had me in class, scored well, and turned in strong work. If you were not an active participant in my class or you did not perform well you should find another source for your recommendation. Writing letters is an added part of the job, and takes me time to do well. I want to write strong letters that will help students get into their preferred grad program, or the fellowship or internship they are applying for.
		  </p>
		  <p>To help me craft the strongest letter possible, I ask that you make your request <em>at least 4 weeks before</em> the letter is due.</p>
		  <p>Please email me with your request, the name of the grad program(s) or internship (etc) that you are applying to, the department you are applying to (if relevant), and the deadline for turning in your letter.</p>
		  <h2>Graduate school recommendations</h2>
		  <p><strong>For graduate school recommendation letters, please email me the following information for each school you are applying to, and include as much useful information as you can. Make it easy for me to write a great letter about you that will be compelling to the admissions committee.</strong></p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>The name of the school, department and program you are applying to.</li>
		    <li>URL link to the specific program.</li>
		    <li>Why now is the right time for you to enter grad school.</li>
		    <li>Why you are interested in that specific school and department.</li>
		    <li>Why you are a good fit for the program.</li>
		    <li>Name several of the standout projects or work you created while in my classes. You should also list the name of the class you did the work in. You may want to include links to the work, images or the original software or project to help me jog my memory and write well about it. Ideally, I can write about how strong your work is and cite these projects as examples.</li>
		    <li>You are also welcome to share any other information with me to help me write a strong letter.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <h2>Other Recommendation Letters</h2>
		  <p>If you are applying to an internship, job, award or fellowship requesting a recommendation, please include as much of the above information as relevant. You should also include the name of the person to address my letter to, and let me know if I should send the letter directly, or if the letter is delivered in some other manner.</p>
		  <p>Thank you! And good luck!</p>
